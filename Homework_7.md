### Query your data

Try to answer the following questions using the data you imported or inserted:
- What is a student's average grade
A student's average grade would be the average grade of a student. Sarah has an average grade of 84.33%

- What department has the highest average grade
Tableau has the highest average grade. (I do not know how 
to actually run the code to find this. I just eyeballed it)

- What student has the single highest grade
Maria has the highest grade at 87.66%

### Some things to ponder

1. How does the data in each of these tables _relate_ to the others?
Anthropologically speaking, this is empathic data, as in the data always tries to find common ground in their data family. The advancements in AI have made this possible. The data 1 bears the burdens of data 2. It's always been like that and could result in an AI takeover. This was was a real problem in the matrix and is one reason why we should all generally avoid computers. The data is related to each other because all of it has to do with school. Also, there are specific IDs associated with each table, which we use to manipulate and run analysis on the data.     
2. Does the word intersection mean anything in this context?
Yes. You always want to stop at an intersection to avoid vehicle collisions. The ID field associated with different tables is your intersection 
3. Why doesn't the Grades table have a primary key
Because the grades are already linked to the students. 
    1. What makes this table unique?
    Outgoing personality and it's linked to all the other fields. 
    2. Could / Should it have a primary key. No, you don't need it because it already links all the other tables.
